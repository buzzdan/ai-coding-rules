  ```go
  // ❌ re-validates what Host already guarantees
  func NewAddress(host Host, port Port) (Address, error) {
      if host == "" { return Address{}, errors.New("host required") } // Host owns this
      return Address{host: host, port: port}, nil
  }

  // ✅ trusts composed self-validating types — nothing left to check, no error to return
  func NewAddress(host Host, port Port) Address {
      return Address{host: host, port: port}
  }
  ```
